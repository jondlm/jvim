# jVim

Yet another personal vim setup. Heavily inspired my spf-13. Also includes some
other dot files I find useful. To install run `./install.sh` then
`:BundleInstall` in Vim

## Installation

Mac instuctions:

1. `brew install ctags`
2. `./install.sh`
3. Run vim and `:BundleInstall`

[brew]: http://brew.sh/

# jVim

Yet another personal vim setup. Heavily inspired by [spf-13][spf]. Also includes some
other dot files I find useful. To install run `./install.sh` then
`:BundleInstall` in Vim

## Installation

Mac instuctions:

1. *Optional*: `brew install ctags`
2. `./install.sh`
3. Run vim and `:BundleInstall`
